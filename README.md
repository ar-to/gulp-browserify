# Semantic HTML5

## How to Use

clone the repo

`git clone git@github.com:ar-to/gulp-browserify.git`

change directory to clone

`cd gulp-browserify`

start node server so you don't have to open the html file manually and to give you the option to expand your front end code with server side code.

`node server.js`

Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Development

This boilerplate is intended to be a quick setup of browserify with gulp. CSS pre-processors have not been added intentionally so this is strictly to make it easy to start working with javascript using a NodeJS style of coding, which is what browserify does.
